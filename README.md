I have nearly 3 years of experience working in companies specializing in web development. Most of the time, I create new websites, web applications, or fix bugs in existing ones. 
I enjoy working with clients, and I'm a very team-oriented person.

🌱 I’m currently learning next.js, testing libraries and docker.
